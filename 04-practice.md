# Practice Using GenAI

You may use any GenAI tools you have access to. The best ones are not free, but they are often not terribly expensive either. For example for $20 / month you can get access to ChatGPT w/ GPT-4 and DALLE-3 (which is what I used when I made these exercises).

Things in AI are changing probably faster than these materials. Feel free to do some searching for newer, better, freer, or just other options. 

Here are some good options that were free as of this writing which can be used for these exercises:

* ChatGPT w/ GPT-3.5 is available for free with an account for text [chat.openai.com](chat.openai.com)
* Google's ImageFX is free with a Google account [https://aitestkitchen.withgoogle.com/tools/image-fx](https://aitestkitchen.withgoogle.com/tools/image-fx)
* Google's Gemini Suite has free options for chat, and the chat can generate images [https://gemini.google.com](https://gemini.google.com)

## Some Notes For This Exercise:

* It's interesting and valuable to compare various AI systems. 
    * Try multiple different systems, compare their outputs.
* Learning is a journey, not a destination.
    * Sometimes you won't get the AI to do exactly what you want. That's alright.
* Do these in whatever order interests you the most. 
    * Getting the most out of AI means leaning into your own strengths and interests. Do that. 

# Task 1: Try to Recreate Specific Images

This task is simple to describe: Select 3 images and try to get a GenAI to make something very very similar to the image you selected. Some tips:

1. Pick images that are in different styles, e.g. a photograph, a charcoal drawing, and a digital illustration.
2. Use detailed prompts including relevant jargon.
3. Pick images and styles with which you are more familiar to make the task easier.

# Task 2: Create a "cover image" For Something You Recently Read

Such as a cover for a book, or an illustration for a magazine article.

# Task 3: Stump The Bot

Pick a topic with which you are very familiar, then try to get the bot making a mistake while talking about that topic. Some tips:

1. Current models are excellent writers but their reasoning skills are still generally a weakness. Ask the bot to make inferences based on facts.
2. Current models have "approximate knowledge of many things" but will sometimes get simple facts wrong because they're predicting "likely next words" not "remembering facts."
3. Tell the bot it's wrong even when it's right, sometimes the results are interesting.

# Task 4: Impersonate Yourself

Collect some samples of your own writing then try to make the bot impersonate your style.

# Task 5: Specialized Summary

Here are a few tasks that are fundamentally "summarization" tasks, something at which GenAI excels. Try some of these:

## Recipe <---> Shopping List:

Give the bot a list of ingredients and ask for a recipe. Or the reverse, copy a recipe from the internet and ask the bot to generate a shopping list for you.

## Get the Gist Of an Article

Copy the text of an email, article, or similar into the prompt and ask for a summary. Bonus points: check the AI's work for mistakes.

## Ask for an overview of a book or topic with which you're familiar

Similarly, check for mistakes.
